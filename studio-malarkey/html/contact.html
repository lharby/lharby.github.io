<p>CONTACT THE STUDIO.</p>
<p>
    Studio Malarkey is a private workspace for <a href="/malarkey-members">three artists</a>, 
    but as we consider what we'd like for the future of this space, 
    we're inviting ideas/expressions of interest from creatives for short-term projects in the <a href="/studio">main space</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Access notes: The studio is on the third floor of a historic building which unfortunately only has stair access. 
    We urge anyone approaching us with public-facing ideas to consider hybrid in-person/online access.

    Additional notes:

<ul class="plain-list">
    <li>We expect any expressions of interest to include a level of mindfulness and respect for the comfort and health of others. We do not enter the studio if we are ill and we require the same consideration from anyone wishing to visit or work with us.</li>
    <li>Sorry, no oil paint use in the studio. It's worse than glitter.</li>
</ul>
