    <a href="https://www.sampgibson.com/" target="_blank">Sam P Gibson</a> is an
    artist based in Northamptonshire, UK.
</p>
<p>
    An embroiderer for over 45 years, her work is typographical, mixing painting
    and stitch to recreate snapshots of conversation or thoughts.
</p>
<p>
    Sam likes nothing more than turning a three-second joke into an arduous
    sewing task that takes months.
</p>
<p>
    Sam also works with miniatures, photography and is interested in creating
    relics, myths and fake histories. An ongoing drawing and stitched project
    involves collaborating with every person she meets.

    Boo, when she is present, is Head of Security. Despite her stunning looks
    and vivaciousness Boo is a seasoned professional having had quite a few
    years under her belt. When visiting the studio we advise giving her lots of
    attention and praise, and throwing a tennis ball for her. She enjoys walks,
    chomps and lots of sniffs especially in the autumn leaves or the winter
    snow.&nbsp;
