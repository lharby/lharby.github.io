                >Sam P Gibson</a
            >
            is an artist based in Northamptonshire, UK.
        </p>
        <p>
            An embroiderer for over 45 years, her work is typographical, mixing
            painting and stitch to recreate snapshots of conversation or
            thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sam likes nothing more than turning a three-second joke into an
            arduous sewing task that takes months.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sam also works with miniatures, photography and is interested in
            creating relics, myths and fake histories. An ongoing drawing and
            stitched project involves collaborating with every person she meets.
