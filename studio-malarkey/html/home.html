<p>WELCOME TO STUDIO MALARKEY.</p>
<p>
    Studio MALARKEY is a new art space in central Northampton. 
    Connected to the working studios of artists Sam Gibson, Jessica Harby and Luke Harby, 
    Studio MALARKEY is now welcoming <a href="/contact">expressions of interest</a> 
    for short-term projects from creative groups and people.
</p>

<p>
    For more information on Studio MALARKEY, visit our <a href="/art-space">Art space</a> page.
</p>

<p>
    Access notes: Studio MALARKEY is on the third floor of an historic building which 
    unfortunately only has stair access. We urge anyone approaching us with public-facing 
    ideas to consider hybrid in-person/online access.
