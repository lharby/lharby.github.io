<p>WELCOME TO STUDIO MALARKEY.</p>
<p>
    Studio Malarkey is a working artist studio in central Northampton.
</p>
<p>
    Sam Gibson, Jessica Harby and Luke Harby occupy spaces at Studio Malarkey connected to a large main space, pictured <a href="/studio">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    As we consider what we'd like for the future, we're inviting <a href="/contact">ideas/expressions of interest</a> from creatives for short-term projects in the main space.
</p>
<p>
    Access notes: The studio is on the third floor of a historic building which unfortunately has only stair access. We urge anyone approaching us with public-facing ideas to consider hybrid in-person/online access.
